# Covid-App
Native Android application to display details about Coronavirus cases around the world


This app is using power of Android Jetpack Components, Kotlin Coroutines, RxJava2 and Room database offline caching. Moreover, this project demonstrate use of RxJava2 with Room and magic operators like Map, Concat, FlatMap, SwitchMap, and Debounce with Single Observable. I have written code in understandable and reusable way, so that even a beginner android developer can use it. I am working on additional functionality of this app.
