# Covid-App
Native Android application to display details about Coronavirus cases around the world
(This app is under development)

This app is using power of Android Jetpack Components, Kotlin Coroutines and RxJava2. Moreover, this project demonstrate use of RxJava2 magic operators like FlatMap, SwitchMap, and Debounce with Single Observable. I have written code in understandable and reusable way, so that even a beginner android developer can use it. I am working on adding additional functionality in this app.
